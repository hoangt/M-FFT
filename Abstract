Abstract:
==============
Accelerators have long been used to improve the performance and energy efficiency of embedded signal processing systems relying on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). 

We explore the benefits of processor-integrated FFT accelerators, characterizing their performance and energ efficiency for current and future memory architectures as well as process and transistor technology. 

First, we evaluate designs that deeply integrate an FFT accelerator into a simple 5-stage RISC pipeline and evaluate the performance and energy efficiency for 32 nm process.  

Our results indicate that a 64-point processor-integrated FFT accelerator alone can increase performance for a 4K FFT by 13-fold. However, when evaluated in a full system, the performance improvement is limited to 8-fold by the DDR3 memory hierarchy. 

In term of energy efficiency, our 64-point FFT accelerator alone increases 12-fold but that improvment is limited to 7-fold once DDR3 memory hierarchy is included.



Second, to explore memory constraint, because memory performance is a critical constraint, we evaluate system configuration with 3D-stacked (future) DRAM systems. Our results indicate that memory performance and 

energy efficiency bottlenecks can be alliviated and delivering improvment of 11-fold and 10-fold for perfomance and energy respectively.

Finally, we explore potential benefits in an extreme future Si technology, reporting the performance and energy benefits that may be expected in 2020 and beyond.  This study employs a DARPA-funded 7nm process and transistor model.
